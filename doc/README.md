### Usage
Two Matrix rooms are required to use this bot.

#### "Reporting" room
This room is open to everyone. Here people can share news any time. Editors can mark messages, but also images and videos with emoji reactions here. Use
- ‚≠ï: Approve a message (to include it in the rendered markdown), or add an image/video to a previously reported item. The image/video will then be automatically added to the corresponding news message, and inserted in the rendered markdown. 
- üõ∞Ô∏è: Add message to the third-party section

Those emojis are just an example, you can configure them as you want in the `config.toml` file. 

#### "Admin" room
In this closed room administrative commands can be executed.

### Configuration
In order to use the bot, two configuration files are required. The `config.toml` configuration file contains the bot settings (username, room ids, etc) and the definitions for the sections and projects. The second configuration file `template.md` serves as a template for the actual summary, and its path may be set using the `TEMPLATE_PATH` environment variable.

The password for the bot is supplied via the `BOT_PASSWORD` environment variable. Setting this will depend on how you start the bot. 

If the bot cannot determine the URL of the home server from the `bot_user_id` setting, it may be supplied by the `HOMESERVER_URL` environment variable.

For both configuration files, examples are available that can be used as templates (see `example_config` folder).

### Deployment
The bot is available as [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/haeckerfelix/hebbot).
You can find an example `docker-compose.yml` inside the `example_config` folder. Be sure to set the `BOT_PASSWORD` variable correctly before using it.
